# EventBrite from Max !  THP, Week 6

Ready to take part in the Eventbrite ? Made with weird code.

By Maxime 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
* You'll have to practice the famous Bundle Install. 
* Then a cool db:create.
* You can now practice with a bad db:migrate!
* Last but not least. A quick db:seed might create for you a few events

* Please create a new user and then a new event to run the app.
  Go into the rails console for it! 

## Running the tests

A coooooool Rspec des familles (which with any doubt, doesn't really work...)

## Built With

* Love
* Shit code

## Prod version

* https://eventbritemax.herokuapp.com/
